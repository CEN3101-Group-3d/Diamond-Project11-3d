## Application

### `client` 
[client](/client#client) is the frontend of the application. It is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).

### `server`

[server](/server#server) is the web server and application server. It is powered by [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Strapi](https://docs-v3.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html).

### `compile`

  [compile](/compile#compile) is an arduino compiler service. It is an unofficial fork of [Chromeduino](https://github.com/spaceneedle/Chromeduino).

<br/>

## Environments

> The project is divided into three conceptual environments.

### Development
Diamond-Project11-Group3d <br/>
The major features we worked on implementing include: <br/>
● Researcher dashboard- will include an overview of studies and data from those
studies for quick and easy viewing, as well as easy comparison with other studies
being conducted by the researcher.

● Consent/Assent Tracking- students consent/assent will be tracked and easily
viewable in either a webpage or pdf format (the latter would make it more
exportable and sharable in the event of an issue).

● Studies- a structure that can hold multiple classrooms and their students in order to
track their data and code usage for analysis of the efficacy of the CASMM app as
a whole. (not fully implemented)

● Code replays- researcher will be able to view the code replays (imaged viewing
form of coding assignment progress) for the classrooms and students that are a
part of their study.

● Grades- researcher will be able to view the average grade of the class as well as
the individual grades of students in order to assess facets of their studies. (not implemented, would be on activity/study screen)

Pictures of implemented features can be found in the complete documentation: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3U1kdGl_aBX5cvzIGDPaPsxVv9zK3HZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105195483003743120752&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Outstanding work: The studies feature is not fully implemented, and more testing needs to be done on the student filter to see if decoupling is possible.

All our work was built upon the existing CASMM app and the associated code of the other roles available.

#### Structure

The development environment is composed of five servers. The first one is run with the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) dev server. The later four are containerized with docker and run with [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

* `casmm-client-dev` - localhost:3000

* `casmm-server-dev` - localhost:1337/admin

* `casmm-compile-dev` 

* `casmm-db-dev` - localhost:5432

  > The first time the db is started, the [init_db.sh](/scripts/init_db.sh) script will run and seed the database with an environment specific dump. Read about Postgres initialization scripts [here](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md#initialization-scripts). To see how to create this dump, look [here](https://github.com/DavidMagda/CaSMM_fork_2023/blob/develop/scripts/readme.md).

* `casmm-compile_queue-dev`

#### Running the project locally

`casmm-client-dev`

1. Follow the [client](/client#setup) setup
2. Run `yarn start` from `/client`

`casmm-server-dev`, `casmm-compile-dev`, `casmm-db-dev`, and `casmm-compile_queue-dev`

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Run `docker compose up` from `/`

   > Grant permission to the **scripts** and **server** directories if you are prompted
   

### Staging

No database or server connections to update.

#### Structure

The staging environment is a Heroku app. It is composed of a web dyno, compile dyno, Heroku Postgres add-on, and Heroku Redis add-on.

* `casmm-staging` - [casmm-staging.herokuapp.com](https://casmm-staging.herokuapp.com/)
  * The web dyno runs `server`
  * The compile dyno runs `compile`

#### Running

`casmm-staging` is automatically built from the latest commits to branches matching `release/v[0-9].[0-9]`. Heroku runs the container orchestration from there.

### Production

#### Structure

The production environment is a Heroku app. It is composed of a web dyno, compile dyno, Heroku Postgres add-on, and Heroku Redis add-on.

* `casmm` - [www.casmm.org](https://www.casmm.org/)
  * The web dyno runs `server`
  * The compile dyno runs `compile`

#### Running

`casmm` is automatically built from the latest commits to `master`. Heroku runs the container orchestration from there.

## Maintenance

All three components of the application have their own dependencies managed in their respective `package.json` files. Run `npm outdated` in each folder to see what packages have new releases. Before updating a package (especially new major versions), ensure that there are no breaking changes. Avoid updating all of the packages at once by running `npm update` because it could lead to breaking changes. 

### Strapi

This is by far the largest and most important dependency we have. Staying up to date with its [releases](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases) is important for bug/security fixes and new features. When it comes to actually upgrading Strapi make sure to follow the [migration guides](https://docs-v3.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides.html#v3-guides)!

<br/>

## CI/CD

All of the deployments and releases are handled automatically with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). The workflows implement custom [Actions](https://github.com/STEM-C/CaSMM/actions) that live in the [auto](https://github.com/STEM-C/auto) repo.

## Contributing

### Git Flow 

> We will follow this git flow for the most part — instead of individual release branches, we will have one to streamline staging deployment

### Branches

#### Protected

> Locked for direct commits — all commits must be made from a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request with one approving review

- **master** - Production application

#### Non-protected

> Commits can be made directly to the branch

- **release** - Staging application
- **develop** - Working version of the application
- **feature/<`scaffold`>-<`feature-name`>** - Based off of develop
  - ex. **feature/cms-strapi**
- **hotfix/<`scaffold`>-<`fix-name`>** - Based off of master
  - ex. **hotfix/client-cors**

### Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, rebase the feature branch into the target branch to resolve any merge conflicts.

- PRs to **master** should squash and merge
- PRs to all other branches should create a merge commit
